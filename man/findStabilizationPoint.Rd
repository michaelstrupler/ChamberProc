\title{Find the stabilization Point of a curve. First, a curve (loess) is fitted to the input data and its first derivative calculated, using finite differences. Then, the index, where the derivative is close to zero is found.}
\usage{
findStabilizationPoint(x, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector with durations}

\item{y}{A vector with the Fluxes, coefficients of variations or standard deviations}
}
\value{
A tibble with the Duration and Flux or SD or CV value where the curve stabilizes
